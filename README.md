# Description
This repository is an exhibition of an API designed for a social network web application. The user can consult the repo to learn how to create an API for a social network web application, using the Mongoose object data modeling library (ODM). The project makes use of Node.js to work with a back end, the Express package to design and configure an API, the Api-Routes package to use a declarative system for creating express API routes, the Moment package to display dates, and the Mongoose package to effectively provide a schema-based solution to model application data.

Here is the demonstration of the application.
